/** \brief Class used to store a collection of nodes
 *
 *  The Kbucket class is a collection of Node elements. In every message
 *  exchange, when nodes are expected as answer, the Kademlia protocol states
 *  that a Kbucket is returned instead. This collection is of fixed size,
 *  usually 20, determine at compile time.
 *
 *  This class provides the underlying structure as well as methods to add,
 *  remove and serialize nodes from it. The underlying structure consist of
 *  a queue of node, with First In First Out policy, where the first elements
 *  are the one that provided an answer after being queried
