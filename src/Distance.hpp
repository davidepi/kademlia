     *  LEFT_DISTANCE and RIGHT_DISTANCE are used to tell whether the distance
     *  should be calculated starting from the msb or lsb first. If BMI is
     *  supported the distance is calculated with a single assembly instruction,
     *  otherwise three steps are needed. Recall that two completely different
     *  keys have maximum distance, so the distance is calculated as
     *  MAX_DISTANCE - position of the first different bit.
     *  If two keys are equal the distance is 0
     *
     *  \return The distance between the two keys, represented as a number
     *  ranging from 0 to the number of bits in the key
